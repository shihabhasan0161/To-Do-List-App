## About The Project

This is a simple to do list app I have created using HTML, CSS and JS.
![To Do List App](https://github.com/shihabhasan0161/To-Do-List-App/blob/main/todolistapp.png?raw=true)

Here's what you can do with this app:
1. You can add a task by clicking on the ‚ûï icon
2. You can remove a task by clicking on the üóëÔ∏è icon
3. You can select the task to mark you have completed it
4. You can count the number of tasks you have in the app
5. You can clear all the tasks at once

I will try to add more functionalities in the future.
